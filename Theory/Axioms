Axios is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from:
the browser (frontend, e.g., React, Vue, Angular)
or Node.js (backend).
It’s built on top of Promises (so it works well with async/await) and is often used to interact with APIs (like fetching data, sending data, updating, or deleting).

Why use Axios (instead of fetch)?
✅ Easier syntax than the native fetch() API.
✅ Supports old browsers (fetch is not supported everywhere).
✅ Automatic JSON handling → Converts response data to JSON automatically.
✅ Request & response interceptors → You can attach logic before requests (e.g., adding auth tokens).
✅ Error handling → Cleaner and easier to manage.
✅ Cancel requests if needed.
