Library (e.g., jQuery, Axios)
A library is a set of pre-written code that helps you with specific tasks.
You are in charge of the application's flow — you decide when to use the library and how.



Framework(e.g. Django, springboot)
A framework provides a structured way to build your web app.
It defines how your app should be built — you follow its rules and patterns.
The framework may call your code at certain points (Inversion of Control).
